#
### binarysearchtree.c
Menu driven C program to create binary search tree. Perform insertion and deletion operations. Display the contents of BST using preorder, inorder and postorder traversal
#
### binarytreetraversal.c
Menu driven C program to create binary tree and to perform preorder, inorder and postorder traversal.
#
### check_balanced.c
C program to check whether given expression is balanced expression or not using stack.
#
### cirqueue_using_array.c
Menu-driven C program implement circular queue using array. Perform enqueue, dequeue and display operations.
